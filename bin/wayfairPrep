Problem Statement
Given a set of data (Coupons and Categories), create a function that will find the coupon to display for a given category.

Input Data
Coupons: List of coupons with category names.
Categories: List of categories with hierarchical parent relationships.
Requirements
Create a function that takes a category name (string) as input and returns the coupon name (string).
Categories without a coupon should inherit their parent's coupon.
If there is no coupon in the category's hierarchy, return null.
If a category has its own coupon, it should not inherit the parent's coupon.
Example edge case:
"Bathroom Accessories" inherits the coupon for "Bed & Bath".
"Toy Organizers" returns null because there are no coupons in its hierarchy.
Examples

Input: "Comforter Sets" => Output: "Comforters Sale"  
Input: "Bedding" => Output: "Savings on Bedding"  
Input: "Bathroom Accessories" => Output: "Low price for Bed & Bath"  
Input: "Soap Dispensers" => Output: "Low price for Bed & Bath"  
Input: "Toy Organizers" => Output: null  


Follow-Up Question 1: Optimization
Problem Statement
The findBestCoupon function is being called billions of times per day, and performance needs to improve. Optimize the function to run in O(1) time complexity.

Requirements
Code must still meet the requirements from the main question.
Replace the current logic (likely O(n)) with a precomputed solution that ensures O(1) lookups.

Follow-Up Question 2: Tiebreaker with DateModified
Problem Statement
The system has added a DateModified field to the coupons. When a category has multiple coupons, use the coupon with the most recent DateModified. Coupons with future dates should be ignored.

Requirements
If a category has multiple coupons, return the one with the most recent DateModified.
Ignore coupons where DateModified is in the future.
Categories without a coupon should still inherit their parent's coupon.
Examples

Input: "Bed & Bath" => Output: "Bed & Bath extravaganza"  
Input: "Bedding" => Output: "Savings on Bedding" OR "Best Bedding Bargains"  
Input: "Comforter Sets" => Output: "Comforters Sale" OR "Cozy Comforter Coupon"  
Input: "Bathroom Accessories" => Output: "Bed & Bath extravaganza" 

Follow-Up Question 3: Discounted Price Calculation
Problem Statement
Given a product name and its price, apply the appropriate coupon discount to calculate the product's discounted price.

Requirements
Create a function that takes a product name (string) as input.
Return the discounted price as a string.
Products inherit coupons from their categories (following the rules in previous questions).
If no coupon applies, return the original price.
Examples
text
Copy code
Input: "Cozy Comforter" => Output: "90.00" OR "85.00"  
Input: "All-in-one Bedding Set" => Output: "32.50" OR "37.50"  
Input: "Infinite Soap Dispenser" => Output: "125.00"  
Input: "Rainbow Toy Box" => Output: "257.00"  
Final Notes
The problem progresses from finding the correct coupon (main question) to optimizing for performance, handling date-based tiebreakers, and applying discounts to products. Each question builds on the previous functionality.
