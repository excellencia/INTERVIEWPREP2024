You make an excellent point. Let me analyze the most critical questions for each part, focusing only on what isn't already clear from the provided input/output formats and requirements.

Part 1 - Basic Coupon Finder:
The input/output format and test cases clearly show:
- The exact structure of categories and coupons
- How parent-child relationships work
- What to return for specific scenarios

The most critical questions here would be:

1. "Can there be circular references in the category hierarchy?"
   This is important because circular references could cause infinite loops in our traversal logic.

2. "What should be returned if the input category name doesn't exist in the system?"
   The test cases don't show this scenario, and it's crucial for error handling.

Part 2 - Performance Optimization:
The requirements clearly state we need O(1) performance and must maintain previous functionality.

The single most critical question here would be:
"Will the category hierarchy change frequently, or is it relatively static?"
   This determines whether we can build a cached lookup structure that rarely needs updating, or if we need a more dynamic solution.

Part 3 - Date Modified Enhancement:
The input format shows dates in "YYYY-MM-01" format, and requirements clearly specify how to handle multiple coupons and future dates.

The most critical question here would be:
"If multiple coupons have the exact same DateModified, which one should be returned?"
   This edge case isn't covered in the requirements and could affect the outcome.

Part 4 - Price Calculation:
The input/output examples show price formats (like "100.00") and expected discount calculations.

The most critical questions would be:

1. "How should we handle rounding in price calculations?"
   This is crucial because decimal arithmetic in programming can lead to precision issues.

2. "Should we validate the discount percentages (like ensuring they're between 0-100%)?"
   This affects the robustness of our solution.

In summary, while many of my earlier suggested questions are answered by the provided format and requirements, these few critical questions address important edge cases and implementation details that could significantly impact the correctness and robustness of our solution. They focus on scenarios that aren't explicitly covered in the requirements but could occur in a real system.

Would you like to discuss how to handle any of these critical edge cases in our implementation?
